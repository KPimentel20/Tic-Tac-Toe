BAD BUNNY THEMED TIC-TAC-TOE

Why this project?

I'm a huge Bad Bunny fan! Also, although Tic-Tac-Toe is just about the most basic game, it's actually really hard to beat, low-key. It brings me back to my elementary days which was really fun to play around with. 

Screenshot(s):

This is the color I chose for my text.

I chose his iconic bunny and third eye logo's for my 'X' and 'O'.

At first, I wanted a background to represent Bad Bunny's unworldly aesthetic.

Then, I began experimenting with other backgrounds that actually center the iconic Perreo artist.

Nothing felt right until I got to this image. He brings this truck prop out at the beginning of every concert to pay homage to his father who drove trucks for a living.

I kept going back and forth between that one and the initial background.

Finally, I decided to go with this image, and it also works well with the icons on my grid!
It also displays a winner's message.

Where there is a tie, you can just rematch.

I will continue working on this game, on its functionality, and its visuals. For now, I'm pretty damn proud of how far I've come with it! Thanks for all of your help!
